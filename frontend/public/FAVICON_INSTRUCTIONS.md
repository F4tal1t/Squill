# Favicon Creation Instructions

Since we cannot create binary files directly, you need to create the favicon manually:

## Option 1: Use Online Favicon Generator
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Use these settings:
   - Text: "S"
   - Background: #20B2AA (Sea Green)
   - Font Color: #141414 (Black)
   - Font Family: Space Grotesk or similar bold font
   - Font Size: 50
   - Shape: Square

## Option 2: Convert SVG to ICO
1. Use the favicon.svg file already created
2. Go to https://convertio.co/svg-ico/
3. Upload favicon.svg
4. Download as favicon.ico
5. Place in public/ directory

## Option 3: Quick Fix (Temporary)
For now, you can copy any existing favicon.ico file to the public directory, or the app will work without it (just with a browser warning).

## Required Files:
- favicon.ico (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes)
- logo192.png (192x192 for PWA)
- logo512.png (512x512 for PWA)

The app will run without these files, but they improve the professional appearance.
